Miria's Gate
============

Project Outline
---------------
Another dugeon crawling I'll be building from scratch. I'll be leveraging some of work I did in my last game Black Dragon 2, specifically the dungeon generator which I will be converting into a stand alone node module.

This project will be writen in typescript, I want to see how it performs compared to vanilla js for game development because there were times when I would run into some hard to find errors related to changing interfaces which would have thrown compiler errors.

I'll be using Redux as a state manager. I really curious about performance and ease of use compared with my hand-rolled state manager and dispatcher from my last project.

I will be deploying all merges to master from day one, this will allow anyone to see the current state of the project and allow me to push updates faster compared with how I deployed with my last project.

Target completion date for this project is three months, starting 5/26/2018 subject to change based on mitigating factors.
